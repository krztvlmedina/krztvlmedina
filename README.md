Hi, I’m Cris! I'm an electric engineering student at CentraleSupélec, France, and at Universidad de Chile, Chile! I'm interested in quite a lot of things, from apps
and videogames development to neuroscience and brain-machine interfaces! I’m currently learning C++ and JavaScript + HTML + CSS. 

I'm currently looking for a 6-months internship in France! Je suis actuellement à la recherche d'un stage de 6 mois en France!
